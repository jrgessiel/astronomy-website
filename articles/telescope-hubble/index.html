                <h2>Telescope</h2>
                <h1>Hubble</h1>
                <p>The astronomers' efforts to understand the universe go far beyond observing the stars here on Earth, for this the human race has developed an object that also represents the effort of wanting to discover more. The hubble is the most important telescope ever built, as it is in space and can capture images without interference from the Earth's atmosphere. Its name is a tribute to the American astronomer Edwin Powell Hubble, responsible for noting the distance of galaxies and the expansion of the universe. The hubble was conceived in 1946, built in the 1970s-80s, and placed in low Earth orbit in 1990.</p>
        
                <p>Over time, Hubble has had several updates and its auxiliary images much research, and although the process has suffered from a high financial cost and many delays, it leaves a message that the effort in favor of science is never in vain!</p>
