                <h1>Astronomy</h1>
                <p>It is science that studies the universe, with its galaxies, stars, planets and various phenomena. Many years ago several civilizations looked up at the sky and believed that stars, planets and galaxies were associated with gods and legends, for they did not possess the knowledge we have today. Over time the celestial stars, we call each of the celestial bodies, have become better understood wich allowed us to develop calendars, establish the seasons and even make the location of the navigators.</p>
                <h3>Your benefits</h3>
                <p>Because of you, today we temos satellites, cel phones, solar panels and various technologies that help us on a day-to-day life. Studying the stars and their phenomena is important to know how the universe, our planet and even them came about!</p>
